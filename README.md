# MajorProjectInterviewChatbot

This project consists of four modules:
1.Skill Extraction from Resume 
2.Question Generation using the Keywords from Interview Answers
3.Answer Evaluation using Semantic Similarity 
4.Face Detection while answering the interview Question

Firstly there will be shortlisting of the candidates based on their technical skills extracted from the resume they submitted. Depending upon the skills extracted, candidates will be interviewed by the chatbot. Questions will be dynamically generated and candidate responses will be stored by the chatbot itself. Surveillance on candidates while attempting to answer the questions will be carried out which also helps in avoiding malpractices. Dynamic question generation based on candidates' responses will also test the connectivity among different concepts known by candidates. Then comes the answer evaluation phase where candidate responses will be compared with stored responses using semantic similarity. The final score will be the average of all the similarity scores for the responses.
